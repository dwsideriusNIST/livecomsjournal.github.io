## Ethics Policies for Reviewers

Ethics policies for reviewers are listed on the [LiveCoMS ethics policy page](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/editorial_policies/publication_ethics#ethical-obligations-of-reviewers). We encourage reviewers to acquaint themselves with these policies.

## LiveCoMS review
Review is to evaluate the quality, relevance, and merit of
submitted papers. Comments should be as complete and detailed as
possible and contain clear opinions about strengths, weaknesses,
relevance, and importance to the field. Comments should be specific
and constructive and suggestions should be intended to enhance the
manuscript.

LiveCoMS uses anonymous reviewer / disclosed author reviews. Reviewers do not directly interact, though are shown other reviewers notes in subsequent revision. 
Editors mediate all interactions between reviewers and authors, and peer reviews are not currently published.  

Specific details on what reviewers as asked to look for are set out in the
sections of the [authors guide](/authors/policies/) for each manuscript type.


## Review Process

 - Reviwers should declare all potential competing, or conflicting, interests. If you are unsure about a potential competing interest that may prevent you from reviewing, do raise this with the editor. Competing interests may be personal, financial, intellectual, professional, political or religious in nature. If you are currently employed at the same institution as any of the authors or have been recent (eg, within the past 3 years) mentors, mentees, close collaborators or joint grant holders, you should not agree to review. In addition, you should not agree to review a manuscript just to gain sight of it with no intention of submitting a review, or agree to review a manuscript that is very similar to one you have in preparation or under consideration at another journal.  Given the closeness of the field, we judge close collaborations leniently - for example, co-authorship on a review with many authors would not disqualify a reviewer. 

- It is important to remain unbiased by considerations related to the nationality, religious or political beliefs,
gender or other characteristics of the authors, origins of a manuscript or by commercial considerations.
If you discover a competing interest that might prevent you from providing a fair and unbiased review, notify
the journal and seek advice

## Conflicts of interest

A reviewer may not have conflict of interest with an author of paper
they are reviewing. A definition of conflict of interest is laid out in section III of the [LiveCoMS bylaws](/policies/livecoms_bylaws/).
